# MediaSound

### Do you want a platform where you can listen to anything, without censorship and opting for free-speech, completely free?
Here, in MediaSound, we want to create a free-license platform to upload whatever you want to say and hear. We take people's safety and freedom seriously. Really.



As a podcast enjoyer, I want to get the concrete podcast category that I desire to listen.

As the leader of the MediaSound team, I want our team-podcasting platform to include playlist sharing that can collaborate in real-time and keep a sequence of podcasts between several users.
